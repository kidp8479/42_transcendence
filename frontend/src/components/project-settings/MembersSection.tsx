// MembersSection.tsx
//
// Displays the users currently belonging to a project.
//
// A project membership is represented by the ProjectMember join table:
// one row = one User belonging to one Project.
//
// This section is responsible for:
// - fetching and displaying the project's current members
// - showing basic member information (avatar initials + username)
// - allowing ADMIN users to remove members
//
// API interactions are handled through projectMembersApi.ts:
//
// GET /api/projects/:projectId/members
//      => retrieves all members of the project
//      => any project member can view the member list
//
// DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/members/:userId
//      => removes a user from the project
//      => only ADMIN members are allowed to perform this action
//
// Permissions:
// - All project members can view this section.
// - Only ADMIN users should see the remove controls.
// - The frontend permission check is only for user experience.
// - The backend always validates permissions to prevent unauthorized API calls.
//
// Member management rules:
// - A member cannot remove themselves unless the backend allows it.
// - Removing the last ADMIN should be prevented by backend validation
//   if that rule exists in the project requirements.
//
// UI responsibilities:
// - Render each member with avatar initials and username.
// - Provide accessible labels for icon-only remove buttons.
// - Update the member list after successful mutations.
